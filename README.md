# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation Project

A Machine Learning-based web application that recommends the best crops and fertilizers for farmers based on soil parameters, weather data, and location. This project aims to help farmers optimize yield and promote sustainable agriculture.

## Features

- **Crop Recommendation:** Suggests suitable crops for a given location and soil condition.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation:** Recommends appropriate fertilizers based on soil nutrients and crop type.
- **User-friendly Web Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for data input and viewing results.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays relevant statistics, recommendations, and charts.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Flask / Django / Streamlit)
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for model development)
- [Other relevant libraries]

## Dataset

- Soil nutrient data
- Crop yield data
- Weather data
- [Add sources or links for datasets used]
